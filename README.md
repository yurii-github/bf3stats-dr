clan signature for battlefield 3 on bf3stats.com

You can use this code as your inspiration etc, but it would be a good tone if remain my name somewhere if use more than 50% of code.


NOTE! I do play in bf3 anymore. But it think you can apply this code for bf4 and so on, unless serverside uses node.js
