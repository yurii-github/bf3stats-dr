<h1>clan signature for battlefield 3 on bf3stats.com</h1>


You can use this code as your inspiration etc, but it would be a good tone if you remain my name somewhere if you use more than 50% of code.


NOTE! I do not play in bf3 anymore. But i think you can apply this code for bf4 and so on untill serverside uses node.js

NOTE! This code was created in 2012y, but i decided to share it in end of 2013y, almost after 2 years.
